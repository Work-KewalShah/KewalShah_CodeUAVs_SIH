## Problem Statement: Measurement of Coastal Topography & Marking High & Low Tide using UAVs

This project aimed to address the challenge of measuring coastal topography and marking high and low tides using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The coastal topography data is crucial for various applications, including environmental monitoring, disaster management, and coastal development planning.

## My Role in the Team

As a member of the project team, my responsibilities included:
- **Machine Learning**: Implementing machine learning algorithms to analyze coastal topography data.
- **Team Management**: Overseeing the coordination and tasks of our team, ensuring a collaborative and efficient workflow.
- **Animation**: Creating a video animation to visually present our project solution ideas during the presentation.

## Technical Details

Our solution leveraged the following technologies and components:
- **Arduino**: We used Arduino microcontrollers for data collection and processing.
- **Ultrasonic Sensors**: Ultrasonic sensors were employed to measure distances and gather topographical data.
- **Arduino Code**: We developed custom Arduino code to interface with the ultrasonic sensors and carry out the detection process. The arduino code can be viewed [here]()
- **Drone Specs**: UAV was a quadcopter with following specs
    - Chassis: F450 Quadcopter Frame 4-Axis
    - ESC: 30A BLDC ESC - Brushless Motor Speed Controller
    - Battery: Orange 3500mAh 3S (11.1 V) LiPo
    - Motor: A2212 1000 KV BLDC Brushless DC Motor for Drone
    - Radio controller: FlySky CT6B 2.4GHz 6CH Transmitter with FS-R6B Receiver
    - Propeller: 1045(10Ã—4.5) SF Propellers Black 1CW+1CCW
